# Love Cebu!

### Thank you for checking my project! And Welcome to Love Cebu! 

![lovecebulogo](assets/logo/lovecebulogo.png)


After considering my First project, I decided to create Love Cebu!, a travel website, solely focusing on Cebu in the Philippines. 

I chose to create a travel-based website focusing on Cebu, because of the sentimental attachment I have to the island and its reputation as a popular travel destination for both local and international visitors from various regions of Asia, Europe, and Canada to name a few. 

Cebu is the 2nd largest city in the Philippines and is located in the heart of the Philippines, in the Visayas region, and is blessed with lots of natural resources… Not to mention, the beautiful beaches. 

But above all, Cebu is my hometown, and where I grew up before moving overseas. Having this as my first project is an honour and tribute to the island of Cebu.

As we say in the Philippines, **_"Mabuhay!" ("Welcome!")._** 


# UX 

## 1) Goals of the Project (Love Cebu! wants to:)

I chose Love Cebu!, as the name of my website and for this project, is because I got the inspiration from Cape Town, South Africa’s travel website called [“Love Capetown,”](https://www.capetown.travel/).

But aside from that, I want people to know that there’s a reason to Love Cebu! Through this website. Furthermore, Love Cebu! wants to: 

* To attract users with the content and look of the entire website.
* To provide information to users and making it interactive.
* To drive attraction and attention to users who are planning to visit the island and are looking for information under one website. 
* To promote the island’s tourism and the reason why Cebu should be their choice of destination.  
* To provide information to users in terms of activities and affordability that suits their needs of Cebu.
* To attract both international and local users to visit Cebu through the information provided on the site. 

## 2) As the site owner, what do we expect from Love Cebu! Website?

* Users are able to reach out to us through our Social media pages and leverage them to build a strong website presence to drive users to the site. 
* Users are able to contact us via the contact link provided.
* To attract different type of demographic to the site.

* That the site is easy to navigate and will provide information that fits what they’re looking for. 
* Advice on how to get to Cebu and the cost of getting there or expenses on activities, food, and drinks. 

## 5) User Stories: 

* As a user, I want to search for an alternative travel destination that is warm all year round.
* As a user, I want to find information about the destination all in one site.
* As a user, I want to find activities that are based on my interest. 
* As a user, I want to receive essential information regarding destination and travel booking options.

# Color theme
* Cebu is a tropical island, and has a very vibrant atmosphere, I came up with some vibrant and Fiesta colours that compliments the logo of Love Cebu! 
* I used the site [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to get colour inspiration for the site. 
* Colours that were chosen were: 
  * #ffdab9 (Peach Puff) - Used for the body of the site and a highlight to the index.html Jumotron slogan "Cebu...Queen City of the South."
  * #e77728 (Bright Orange) - Used as a background colour for the Navbar, Footer, buttons, and Section separator on pages. It's also been used on some words on the Jumbotron or Intro texts.
  * #f9b81d (Vivid Orange) - Used in Contact form, when you over the Nav list, buttons and also used on some words on the Jumbotron slogan.
  * #ff1616 (Vivid Red) - Used on some words on every page, except the Contact page. This is to blend with the "Love" word on the Love Cebu! logo which is the same colour. 
  * #fff (White) - Used as a text colour for the Nav lists, Social media links on Footer, and on Section separator on the Home page.
  * Black has also been used as a default colour text, especially on articles and on the Experience Cebu page. 

# Font 
* Initially, 2 colours were chosen for the site. Merriweather and Lato. But I decided for uniformity, I went for Merriweather. 

# Logo Design theme
* Love Cebu! theme was chosen with the use of [Canva](https://www.canva.com/).
* Font name: Luckiest Guy 
* I chose the design because of the fun and personal theme it has. A Mango icon was added to the logo, which is a fruit that Cebu is known for.
* These are the colour themes of the logo: 
    * Love - #ff1616
    * Cebu! - #ff914d
    * Brush stroke background - #ffdcba
    * Mango - had default colours of #47c098, #cb8456, #edaf1a, #f9b81d
* The White background on the logo was removed using [remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/).
