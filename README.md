# Love Cebu!

### Thank you for checking my project! And Welcome to Love Cebu! 

![lovecebulogo](assets/logo/lovecebulogo.png)


After considering my First project, I decided to create Love Cebu!, a travel website, solely focusing on Cebu in the Philippines. 

I chose to create a travel-based website focusing on Cebu, because of the sentimental attachment I have to the island and its reputation as a popular travel destination for both local and international visitors from various regions of Asia, Europe, and Canada to name a few. 

Cebu is the 2nd largest city in the Philippines and is located in the heart of the Philippines, in the Visayas region, and is blessed with lots of natural resourcesâ€¦ Not to mention, the beautiful beaches. 

But above all, Cebu is my hometown, and where I grew up before moving overseas. Having this as my first project is an honour and tribute to the island of Cebu.

As we say in the Philippines, **_"Mabuhay!" ("Welcome!")._**
