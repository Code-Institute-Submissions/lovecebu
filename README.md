# Love Cebu!

### Thank you for checking my project! And Welcome to Love Cebu! 

![lovecebulogo](assets/logo/lovecebulogo.png)


After considering my First project, I decided to create Love Cebu!, a travel website, solely focusing on Cebu in the Philippines. 

I chose to create a travel-based website focusing on Cebu, because of the sentimental attachment I have to the island and its reputation as a popular travel destination for both local and international visitors from various regions of Asia, Europe, and Canada to name a few. 

Cebu is the 2nd largest city in the Philippines and is located in the heart of the Philippines, in the Visayas region, and is blessed with lots of natural resources… Not to mention, the beautiful beaches. 

But above all, Cebu is my hometown, and where I grew up before moving overseas. Having this as my first project is an honour and tribute to the island of Cebu.

As we say in the Philippines, **_"Mabuhay!" ("Welcome!")._**

# UX 

## Project Goals

I chose Love Cebu!, as the name of my website and for this project, is because I got the inspiration from Cape Town, South Africa’s travel website called [“Love Capetown,”](https://www.capetown.travel/).

But aside from that, I want people to know that there’s a reason to Love Cebu! Through this website. Furthermore, Love Cebu! wants to: 

* To attract users with the content and look of the entire website.
* To provide information to users and making it interactive.
* To drive attraction and attention to users who are planning to visit the island and are looking for information under one website. 
* To promote the island’s tourism and the reason why Cebu should be their choice of destination.  
* To provide information to users in terms of activities and affordability that suits their needs of Cebu.
* To attract both international and local users to visit Cebu through the information provided on the site. 

## Website Expectations

* Users are able to reach out to us through our Social media pages and leverage them to build a strong website presence to drive users to the site. 
* Users are able to contact us via the contact link provided.
* To attract different type of demographic to the site.
* To give a subliminal message that Cebu is a friendly and fun island to visit as they browse around the site. 
* To give a message that it is personally speaking to the user to invite them to Cebu. 
* To encourage users to use our affiliate links without going through an external site to monetize the site. 

## User Requirements

* The site can be accessed on Desktop, Mobile, and Tablet.
* A contact page to reach out to the site owner.
* Social media pages when they need to alternatively contact site owner outside the Love Cebu! Website.
* The site to be consistently responsive. 


## Users Expectations

* A site that has images and videos of Cebu. 
* A link for when they would like to book travel arrangements to Cebu. 
* A site that has a social media page when they want to interact and engage with the site owner via those channels. 
* That the site is easy to navigate and will provide information that fits what they’re looking for. 
* Advice on how to get to Cebu and the cost of getting there or expenses on activities, food, and drinks. 

## User Stories 

* As a user, I want to search for an alternative travel destination that is warm all year round.
* As a user, I want to find information about the destination all in one site.
* As a user, I want to find activities that are based on my interest. 
* As a user, I want to receive essential information regarding destination and travel booking options.
* As a user, I want to find a destination that fits my budget. 
* As a user, I want a travel website that can respond to any further queries that I may have. 
* As a user, I want to be immersed in the destination as if I am already there.

# Wireframes

My wireframes were all created using [Balsamiq wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/). I’ve individually created wireframes for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile versions. 

An updated wireframes were also created to match the final layout of the website. 

Reasons why I had to update the wireframes: 
* I removed the weather widget app as it wasn't responsive to how I wanted it positioned when testing it using tablet and mobile.
* Contact forms removed on the Home, Experience Cebu, Ready to Visit and About pages and kept it on the Contact page as it felt redundant. 
* Updated the footer to get the copyright, social media logos and brand logo to be centered. 
* As I had some ideas changed on the Final execution of the website on the Experience Cebu and Ready to Visit page, I wanted my Wireframe to mirror how it should look like to the website I created. 

Both my initial and updated wireframes can be viewed here: [Wireframes](https://github.com/GlobetrotterG/lovecebu/tree/master/wireframes)

* Cebu is a tropical island, and has a very vibrant atmosphere, I came up with some vibrant and Fiesta colours that compliments the logo of Love Cebu! 
* I used the site [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to get colour inspiration for the site. 
* Colours that were chosen were: 
  * #ffdab9 (Peach Puff) - Used for the body of the site and a highlight to the index.html Jumotron slogan **"Cebu...Queen City of the South."**
  * #e77728 (Princeton Orange) - Used as a background colour for the Navbar, Footer, buttons, and Section separator on pages. It's also been used on some words on the Jumbotron or Intro texts.
  * #f9b81d (Selcetive Yellow) - Used in Contact form, when you over the Nav list, buttons and also used on some words on the Jumbotron slogan.
  * #ff1616 (Red RYB) - Used on some words on every page, except the Contact page. This is to blend with the **"Love"** word on the Love Cebu! logo which is the same colour. 
  * #fff (White) - Used as a text colour for the Nav lists, Social media links on Footer, and on Section separator on the Home page.
  * #000000 (Black) - Used as a default colour text, especially on articles and on the Experience Cebu page.

# Font 
* Initially, 2 fonts were chosen for the site, which were Merriweather and Lato. But I decided for uniformity, and went for [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather), and picked fonts 400, 700 and 900. 

# Logo Design theme
* Love Cebu! theme was chosen with the use of [Canva](https://www.canva.com/).

# Testing

## Weather widget
I initially included a weather widget app to my Navbar, which I got from [hotelmix](https://hotelmix.co.uk/?page=weather_widget_customize&type=30&cityID=19019&cmetric=1&gparams=30#). They provided an embedded HTML code, however it was copyrighted, which meant I couldn't change anything with their code. 
I wrapped it around a Div, and styled it without affecting their code using CSS. It was responsive on a laptop and desktop, but it didn't respond to how I wanted it to look on a mobile and tablet, and I made the decision of removing it instead. 

## Embed Google Map
With the help of a [Google](https://www.google.com/) search, I was able to find an alternative to embedding a Google map using [Embed Google map](https://www.embedgooglemap.net/en/). The embed code was responsive on all devices, and managed to move the inline style codes from HTML to CSS for consistency. 

## Website responsiveness
* Site was coded using a Dell XPS 13 laptop and also used it to test website responsiveness on laptop.
* Mobile site version was tested using an iphone 7 Plus, Samsung Galaxy S10+, Google Pixel 3a XL phones. 
* Tablet site version was tested on an ipad Air.
* To test overall website responsiveness for Laptop, Desktop, Mobile and Tablet, I also used Google Chrome DevTools.
* HTML code was tested using [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
* CSS code was tested using [W3C CSS Markup Validation Service - Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
