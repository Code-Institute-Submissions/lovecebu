# Love Cebu!

### Thank you for checking my project! And Welcome to Love Cebu! 

![lovecebulogo](assets/logo/lovecebulogo.png)


After considering my First project, I decided to create Love Cebu!, a travel website, solely focusing on Cebu in the Philippines. 

I chose to create a travel-based website focusing on Cebu, because of the sentimental attachment I have to the island and its reputation as a popular travel destination for both local and international visitors from various regions of Asia, Europe, and Canada to name a few. 

Cebu is the 2nd largest city in the Philippines and is located in the heart of the Philippines, in the Visayas region, and is blessed with lots of natural resources… Not to mention, the beautiful beaches. 

But above all, Cebu is my hometown, and where I grew up before moving overseas. Having this as my first project is an honour and tribute to the island of Cebu.

As we say in the Philippines, **_"Mabuhay!" ("Welcome!")._** 


# UX 

## 1) Goals of the Project (Love Cebu! wants to:)

I chose Love Cebu!, as the name of my website and for this project, is because I got the inspiration from Cape Town, South Africa’s travel website called [“Love Capetown,”](https://www.capetown.travel/).

But aside from that, I want people to know that there’s a reason to Love Cebu! Through this website. Furthermore, Love Cebu! wants to: 

* To attract users with the content and look of the entire website.
* To provide information to users and making it interactive.
* To drive attraction and attention to users who are planning to visit the island and are looking for information under one website. 
* To promote the island’s tourism and the reason why Cebu should be their choice of destination.  
* To provide information to users in terms of activities and affordability that suits their needs of Cebu.
* To attract both international and local users to visit Cebu through the information provided on the site. 

## 2) As the site owner, what do we expect from Love Cebu! Website?

* Users are able to reach out to us through our Social media pages and leverage them to build a strong website presence to drive users to the site. 
* Users are able to contact us via the contact link provided.

* That the site is easy to navigate and will provide information that fits what they’re looking for.

## 5) User Stories:

* As a user, I want to find information about the destination all in one site.
* As a user, I want to find activities that are based on my interest.
