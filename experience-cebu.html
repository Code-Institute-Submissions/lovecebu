            <p>
              Getting there can be a trek. We suggest that you hire a private

              services to Sirao.

              For a small entrance fee, this place has a great view of the
              nature scenery, and not to mention, a lot of Instagrammable

                It was built in honour of a man’s love to his woman. Let’s just

              <p>
                This is one of the most interesting and exciting activity in
                Cebu! Located in the southern part of Cebu, which is in a town
                called Oslob. It is a 3-4 hour journey (depending on the traffic
                and time).
              </p>
              <p>
                The cheapest way to get there is by bus from Cebu City South Bus
                Terminal. We suggest getting there very early in the morning, as
                it gets very busy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another option, is to stay in one of the guest houses or hotels
                within the area that fits your budget.

                8.) Try Cebuano food and Delicacies
              </h2>
              <p>
                Cebu is known for its delicious food as well as delicacies
                (North or South of the island, there are special delicacies to
                try).
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the most popular food is Lechon, also known as Roast Pig.
                The taste is very distinct compared to the other regions of the
                Philippines.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another popular food is Mango. The mangoes are golden yellow and
                naturally sweet. They are also turned into dried mangoes, and
                are very popular amongst the international visitors.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rice is the staple of the Philippines, and is eaten 3 times a
                day. When enjoying a Cebuano dish in a food market, you will
                notice that the rice may be wrapped in dried diamond-shaped
                banana leaves called “Puso” or “Hanging Rice.”

                Bantayan Island is blessed with crystal clear water and White
                Sandy beaches. It is truly an island paradise, located in the
                North of Cebu.
              </p>
              <p>
                Getting there can be an adventure, as you will be driving or
                taking a bus from North City Bus Terminal station to San Remigio
                which takes around 2 and a half hours, and then take a barge /
                ship to Bantayan Island, which takes around 1 hour.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are resorts that fits everyone’s budget, and is affordable
                for visitors. Aside from the beautiful beach that the island
                proudly boasts, we recommend other activities such as a visit to
                Obo-ob Mangrove Eco Park for relaxation.

                For those with kids, this is definitely a place to visit. They
