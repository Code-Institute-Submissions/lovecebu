            Cebu is geographically stretched and elongated. From North to South,
            there is always something exciting that awaits visitors to the
            island. We pick the Ten things to do when you're in Cebu:

          <!-- Top 10 lists -->
          <h2 class="experience-list">1.) Magellan’s Cross</h2>
          <p>
            This is one of Cebu’s most-iconic landmark. The cross was planted by
            the Spanish and Portuguese explorers ordered by Ferdinand Magellan
            back in 1521. This marked the Filipinos Christianised in the island.
            The cross is a replica of the original, which was believed to be
            destroyed when Ferdinand Magellan died.

          <h2 class="experience-list">2.) Santo Niño Church</h2>
          <p>
            This is one of Cebu’s most-iconic landmark. The cross was planted by

            back in 1521. This marked the Filipinos Christianised in the island.
            The cross is a replica of the original, which was believed to be

          <h2 class="experience-list">3.) Sinulog Mardi Gras</h2>
          <p>
            Sinulog is a religious celebration in honour of the patron saint,
            Santo Nino. The Mardi gras takes place on the 3rd Sunday of January,
            and Cebu City is turned into a massive street festival. It is one of
            the most visited festivity and dancers in their colourful costumes
            parades the streets in their individual Sinulog-themed dance. One
            thing that you will notice is a Festival Queen carrying a Santo
            Nino, and plays an important part in the groups Sinulog dance. This
            is definitely a must visit!
          </p>

          />
          <h2 class="experience-list">4.) Sirao Gardens</h2>
          <p>
            Another place of interest is Sirao Gardens which is located in the
            hills of Busay. Getting there can be a trek. We suggest that you
            hire a private transport to get there, although tour companies also
            provide services to Sirao. For a small entrance fee, this place has
            a great view of the nature scenery, and not to mention, a lot of
            Instagrammable landmarks that will make your trip up there worth it.
            (Keep an eye out for the famous hand statue).

          />
          <h2 class="experience-list">5.) Temple of Leah</h2>
          <p>
            Before making your way up to Sirao Gardens, don’t forget to drop by
            to the Temple of Leah. There is also an entrance fee required to
            enter. At first, you will feel that you are somewhere in Rome or
            Greece with this Roman-inspired architecture. The place has a
            romantic story behind it. It was built in honour of a man’s love to
            his woman. Let’s just say it has a similar romantic reason to
            building the Taj Mahal in India.

          />
          <h2 class="experience-list">6.) Swimming with the Whale Sharks</h2>
          <p>
            This is one of the most interesting and exciting activity in Cebu!
            Located in the southern part of Cebu, which is in a town called
            Oslob. It is a 3-4 hour journey (depending on the traffic and time).
            The cheapest way to get there is by bus from Cebu City South Bus
            Terminal. We suggest getting there very early in the morning, as it
            gets very busy. Another option, is to stay in one of the guest
            houses or hotels within the area that fits your budget.

          <h2 class="experience-list">7.) Kawasan Falls</h2>
          <p>
            If you are planning to do a trip around the South of Cebu, then we
            recommend a trip to Kawasan Falls. Located in the town of Badian,
            this is the most popular waterfalls in Cebu. For the adventurous,
            this is one of your best options as they offer canyoneering
            adventures. So we recommend a whole for this experience.

          <h2 class="experience-list">8.) Try Cebuano food and Delicacies</h2>
          <p>
            Cebu is known for its delicious food as well as delicacies (North or
            South of the island, there are special delicacies to try). One of
            the most popular food is Lechon, also known as Roast Pig. The taste
            is very distinct compared to the other regions of the Philippines.
            Another popular food is Mango. The mangoes are golden yellow and
            naturally sweet. They are also turned into dried mangoes, and are
            very popular amongst the international visitors. Rice is the staple
            of the Philippines, and is eaten 3 times a day. When enjoying a
            Cebuano dish in a food market, you will notice that the rice may be
            wrapped in dried diamond-shaped banana leaves called “Puso” or
            “Hanging Rice.”
          </p>

            height="300"
            width="500"
          />
          <h2 class="experience-list">9.) Visit Bantayan Island</h2>
          <p>
            Bantayan Island is blessed with crystal clear water and White Sandy
            beaches. It is truly an island paradise, located in the North of
            Cebu. Getting there can be an adventure, as you will be driving or
            taking a bus from North City Bus Terminal station to San Remigio
            which takes around 2 and a half hours, and then take a barge / ship
            to Bantayan Island, which takes around 1 hour. There are resorts
            that fits everyone’s budget, and is affordable for visitors. Aside
            from the beautiful beach that the island proudly boasts, we
            recommend other activities such as a visit to Obo-ob Mangrove Eco
            Park for relaxation.

          <h2 class="experience-list">10.) Anjo World</h2>
          <p>
            Cebu finally have its own theme-park in the name of Anjo World,
            located in Minglanilla, which is roughly around 1 hour drive
            (depending on traffic, and be a bit longer) from Cebu City. For
            those with kids, this is definitely a place to visit. They even have
            their own version of the London Eye which they call the “Anjo Eye.”
